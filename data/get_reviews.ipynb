We included any trial randomised or non randomised conducted at any scale, with a parallel control group that compared a strategy to implement policies or practices to address diet, physical activity, overweight or obesity, tobacco or alcohol use by school staff to 'no intervention' , 'usual' practice or a different implementation strategy.</th>\n",
